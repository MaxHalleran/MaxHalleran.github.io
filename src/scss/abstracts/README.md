# Abstracts

The `abstracts/` folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers used across the project. Every global function, mixin and placeholder should be put in here. 

The rule of thumb for this folder is that it should not output a single line of CSS when compiled on its own. These are nothing but Sass helpers.

Font imports are also dealt with in this folder.

## Fonts included:

## Functions:

## Mixins:

## Variables:
Variables are currently used for:
- Colors
- Border Settings
- Responsive Breakpoints

Variable naming convention follows [sass-lang's][1] examples.
